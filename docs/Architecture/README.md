# System Architecture Overview

## Overview

Tokugawa Academy is a Discord-based roleplaying game built with Python, using a modular architecture to provide a scalable and maintainable platform. The system is designed to handle multiple concurrent game sessions, character interactions, and story progression.

## Core Components

### Discord Bot Service
- Discord.py for bot interactions
- Command handling system
- Event management
- Game state synchronization

### Game Engine
- Core game logic in Python
- Story progression management
- Character state management
- Event system using Python's asyncio

### Database Layer
- DynamoDB for game state storage
- SQLite for local development
- Data models using Pydantic
- Async database operations

### State Management
- In-memory state for active sessions
- Persistent storage in DynamoDB
- State synchronization
- Cache management

## System Flow

1. User interacts with Discord bot
2. Discord.py event handler processes command
3. Game engine updates state
4. Changes are persisted to database
5. Response is sent back to user

## Scalability

- Async/await for concurrent operations
- DynamoDB auto-scaling
- ECS Fargate for container management
- Efficient state management

## Security

- Discord OAuth2 authentication
- AWS IAM roles and policies
- Data encryption at rest
- Secure communication channels

## Monitoring

- CloudWatch for metrics and logs
- Python logging system
- Custom metrics for game analytics
- Alert system for critical events

## Development Environment

- Python virtual environments
- Docker for containerization
- LocalStack for AWS services
- DynamoDB local for database
- Mock Discord API for testing
